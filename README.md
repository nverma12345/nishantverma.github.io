# JS-Personal-page
This is my personal page, I have kept it very very simple and to the point, my focus is just on putting out the information with simplicity. You can use this repository to make your own personal page, you don't need to be an expert to do so. Just follow the steps given below.

## Usage

- Fork it on github.
- Rename repository to '**youUserName**.github.io'.
- Replace the content of `data.json` to your information.
- Replace the content of meta tags and head in `index.html`.

> validate the `data.json` format once you are done adding your information, otherwise it will pop some error.
